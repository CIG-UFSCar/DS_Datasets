Description:

	Instances divided in classes, represented as gaussians, that move within the 2-dimensional space, overlapping in some places.

	Generated with package streamMOA in R (set.seed(1000)), by calling function DSD_RandomRBFGeneratorEvents changing from default value parameters modelSeed = 1000, instanceSeed = 1000, numClusterRange = 7, eventMergeSplitOption = TRUE, eventFrequency = 5000.

	Behaviour: starts with three classes moving, a cluster of noisy data is derived from a split event. The noisy data merges with all three classes (turning the data to noise). The dense cluster suffers a split event, generating a fourth class that eventually merges with the noisy cluster.
