Description:

	Instances divided in classes, represented as gaussians, that move within the 2-dimensional space, overlapping in some places.

	Generated with package streamMOA in R (set.seed(1000)), by calling function DSD_RandomRBFGeneratorEvents changing from default value parameters modelSeed = 1000, instanceSeed = 1000, numClusterRange = 7, eventDeleteCreate = TRUE, eventFrequency = 5000.

	Behaviour: starts with three classes moving; A cluster of noisy data is created; Later, a fourth class is created; The cluster of noisy data is deleted; A fifth class is created; A sixth class is created; A seventh class is created (maximum range); One of the starter classes is deleted.
